# Releasing a New Version of xcutility
## 1. Create the Release Notes
Document what‚Äôs changed, keeping an eye out for breaking changes that will affect the version number.

Release notes typically follow this pattern:

> **Fixed**
> * Something was fixed (#pr-number). Thanks @pr-author!
> 
> **Added**
> * Something was added (#pr-number). Thanks @pr-author!
> 
> **Improved**
> * Something was improved (#pr-number). Thanks @pr-author!
> 
> Thank you to {authors of PRs that improved code quality} for improvements to the code base! Thank you to {reviewers of PRs} for reviewing pull requests!

Try to call out more important items earlier in the list.

You can use the [compare](https://github.com/jeffctown/xcutility/compare) page on GitHub to see what‚Äôs changed since the previous release. Typically only the merge commits (those of the form _Merge pull request #2342 from branch-name_) are needed. Click the link to the PR to see what changed.

## 2. Update Version Number
If the changes in this release are breaking, then increment the minor number (`0.26.0` to `0.27.0`). Otherwise increment the patch number (`0.26.0` to `0.26.1`).

The version number needs to be set in the `Version` struct.

## 3. Create Draft Release
Create a [new release](https://github.com/jeffctown/xcutility/releases/new) on GitHub. The tag version should always be 3 numbers (i.e. `0.26.0`, not `0.26`). Check _This is a pre-release_ for now.

## 4. Create Installer

This step will require [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to be installed.

Now that you‚Äôve created the release, do a `git pull`: you need the tag locally when you create the installer.

Run `make release` to run most of the release process and install the latest version. It‚Äôs probably a good idea to run `xcutility version` to make sure that you‚Äôve picked up the changes.

## 5. Publish Release
Edit the release you created. Add the `XCUtility.pkg` and `XCUtilityFramework.framework.zip` that were created, uncheck _This in a pre-release_, and publish! Congratulations, you‚Äôve published the release! üëè
